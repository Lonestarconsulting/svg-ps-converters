# Tools to Export Images into SVG Tiny Portable/Secure Format

## Summary

The goal of this project is to develop various open source tools that will export a vector image into a new SVG format that's a more secure profile of the SVG Tiny 1.2 format. The new format is more restrictive than [SVG Tiny 1.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/) as defined by the W3C and requires modification to standard SVG documents.

The new [SVG Tiny Portable/Secure (SVG P/S)](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-svg-tiny-ps-abrotman-00.txt) format is specified by a new document published to the IETF. In addition to the specification document, a [SVG P/S RELAX NG Compact (RNC) XML](https://bimigroup.org/resources/SVG_PS-latest.rnc.txt) scheme validation file has also been developed that can be used to verify the output is compliant with the new SVG P/S format.

## Initial Prototypes

The initial v.01 prototype source code was developed by Mouaad Boukiaou, and has all been released under an [MIT licence](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
